### Data Description

The data I used is for this is the 2018 - 2019 Raptors season. It gives information like the game number, game opponent, Raptor score, opponent score and much more. With many great seasons that Raptors had, I believe this is the greatest Raptor season where they went to the finals. This season had the most games and overall, had the most content to work with.
