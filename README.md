### Data Description

The data I used is for this is the 2018 - 2019 Raptors season. It gives information like the game number, game opponent, Raptor score, opponent score and much more. With many great seasons that Raptors had, I believe this is the greatest Raptor season where they went to the finals. This season had the most games and overall, had the most content to work with.

### Why I selected this data set

The reason why I selected this data set is because the Toronto Raptors are my favourite team in the league and I wanted to choose their champion season to represent the data for my project. I have always liked the NBA since I was young and have been following statistics about it for a long time. I enjoyed watching games and being able to dive into the statistics made me have a better appreciation for the game as I realized now that statistics often don't tell the whole story about the game. I enjoyed analyzing the data for this Raptor season and I hope you enjoy my program on it.
